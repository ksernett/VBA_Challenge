  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    - With conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red. 
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.

## VBA Script

- The completed script is provided in the StockMarket.vb file.

## Results

- Further analysis of these results can identify changes across the three years of data provided.
